Prerequisites:

 - omake
 - Ocamlnet (version 3.2 or better)
 - findlib (ocamlfind)
 - pcre-ocaml

The prerequisites must be installed so that findlib (ocamlfind) knows
about them.

If you want to regenerate the methods file with amqp_gen, you will also
need PXP. Normally, this is not needed, though.

Then:

 - make all

   builds the software

 - make install

   installs the software at the location findlib suggests

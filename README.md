NetAMQP, an AMQP implementation for OCaml

The original source for NetAMQP dropped off the net. The initial commit
of the copy on github at https://github.com/mk270/netamqp is faithful
to what could be scraped together from archive sources. Fixes will be
accepted to this repo, but an actual maintainer is required long-term.
